# FakeHall - Fake the hall signal of a hoverboard

Fake the hall project is a testing toll for an other experiment where  I would
like to hijack a hoverboard in a most simple way possible.
It generates fake signal similar to original one, except this use square wave
signal instead of sinusoid one.

## Update
The sinusoid wave come from my broken earth pin in the power strip. What makes the masking features useless.
So I turned the masking features to off by default.
