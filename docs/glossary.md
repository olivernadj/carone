**Daughterboard** - is an extension of the motherboard of a computer. However, unlike an expansion board, it is not simply another device added to a motherboard to increase its functionality. Instead, it provides the circuitry for an integral function of the motherboard. Without the daughterboard, a motherboard that depends on it will not function. [\[3\]][3]

**Battery** - This battery pack is made of 20pcs Li-ion 18650 battery cells. Rated Voltage: 36V.

**Charger** - 42V 2A Hoverboard Power AC Adapter Charger.

**Expansion board** - is a PCB that fits into an expansion slot on a desktop computer. An expansion card is used to give a computer additional capabilities, such as enhanced video performance via a graphics card. [\[3\]][3]

**Gyro board** - uses UART 9bit, no parity, 1 stop bit for communication with motherboard.

**Hall effect sensor** - is a transducer that varies its output voltage in response to a magnetic field. Hall effect sensors are used for proximity switching, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications. [\[8\]][8]

**Hoverboard** - A self-balancing scooter is a personal transporter consisting of two motorized wheels connected to a pair of articulated pads on which the rider places their feet. The rider controls the speed by leaning forwards or backwards, and direction of travel by twisting the pads. [\[6\]][6]

**Logic Level Converter** - bi-directional logic level converter is a small device that safely steps down 5V signals to 3.3V AND steps up 3.3V to 5V at the same time. [\[11\]][11]

**NOT gate** - An inverter circuit outputs a voltage representing the opposite logic-level to its input. Its main function is to invert the input signal applied. [\[1\]][1]

**Motherboard** - is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in general purpose microcomputers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system. [\[2\]][2]

**Motor Control Board** - the heart and brain of the smartboard. It is responsible for when and where to throw all that battery power. The main focus of the control board is the six half-H drivers, which drive two 3-phase motors. [\[7\]][7]

**Multiplexer** - In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux) is a device that selects one of several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input into a single line. A multiplexer of inputs has select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output. [\[10\]][10]

**Printed circuit board (PCB)** - mechanically supports and electrically connects electronic components or electrical components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate. Components are generally soldered onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it. [\[5\]][5]

**Schematic diagram** - is a circuit which shows the connections in a clear and standardized way. A schematic diagram shows the components and their values and connections in an understandable manner. It is usually used to communicate or intended to convey the connections and working of the circuit to other engineers. [\[4\]][4]

**Schmitt trigger** - In electronics, a Schmitt trigger is a comparator circuit with hysteresis implemented by applying positive feedback to the noninverting input of a comparator or differential amplifier. It is an active circuit which converts an analog input signal to a digital output signal. [\[9\]][9]

**Sisterboard** - if two daughter or expansion boards have a common motherboard, they are sister.

**Step Down Power Module DC-DC Converter** - is an electronic circuit or electromechanical device that converts a source of direct current (DC) from one voltage level to another.

**Voltage regulator** -  is an electronic circuit that provides a stable DC voltage independent of the load current, temperature and AC line voltage variations. A voltage regulator may use a simple feed-forward design or may include negative feedback. It may use an electromechanical mechanism, or electronic components. [\[12\]][12]

**Wheel motor** - brushless DC motor. It takes eight wires to run these: three large power leads for the three phases (controlled by the motor control board), and five leads for the Hall effect sensors that track the rotorâ€™s position. The feedback from those sensors lets those big transistors on the motor control board know when to switch, making for a nice smooth ride. [\[7\]][7]

**Wiring diagram** - is mainly intended to convey the wiring or connection between the components in a proper way without any confusion, so that one can create a prototype easily using that. [\[5\]][5]
